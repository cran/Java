This is a collection of R scripts used both to illustrate and test
some of the features of the R-Omegahat/Java interface.

Some of the scripts reference classes that are not, by default,
in the Java classpath when the JVM is initialized from within
R. These classes can be found in the jar (Java archive) file 
     org/omegahat/Jars/ROmegahatExamples.jar
within the R package installation.
Use the R command
      system.file("org/omegahat/Jars/ROmegahatExamples.jar")
to find out its full path. Then include this in the classpath 
by setting the environment variable CLASSPATH to include this
element and restart R. Alternatively,  pass the location of the
jar file via the classPath argument of .JavaInit() when initializing
the JVM.

(One can also use Omegahat's ability to dynamically add classes
to the classpath of a running session.
  .Java(.Java("__Evaluator", "localClasses"),"add",
                 system.file("org/omegahat/Jars/ROmegahatExamples.jar"))
)
