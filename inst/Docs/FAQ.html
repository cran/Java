  <dt>
  <li> When I load the shared library (Java.so)
       I get errors about not being able to load a shared
       library or undefined symbols. What's the problem?
  <dd> Most likely, you do not have the environment/shell
      variable <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> set correctly.
      Source one of the <code>RJava.csh</code> or <code>RJava.bash</code> scripts
      that are created during the configuration of the R-Java package.
      To find them, run the R command
<pre>
   system.file("scripts/RJava.csh", pkg="Java") 
</pre>
      The first is for use within C shells (csh and tcsh)
      and the latter for use with the Bourne shell (sh, bash).
      This must be done before starting R.
<p>
      These scripts append the appropriate directories to one's
      <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> variable and makes .
      the Java libraries and support library in the R package
      for Java available to the dynamic loader.

      
  
  <dt>
  <li> When I call <code>.JavaInit()</code>, the prompt never
      returns. Any solution?
  <dd> We have seen this on Linux with IBM's JDK1.3.
       The problem is that when loading the shared library (Java.so)
      one must specify FALSE as the value for <code>local</code>.
       That is
      <pre>
        dyn.load("Java.so", local=FALSE)
      </pre>
      The automatic configuration attempts to get this correct
      and put the appropriate  call in <code>.First.lib</code>.

  <dt>
  <li> On Solaris, when I initialize the Java Virtual Machine,
      I get a paragraph about needing to apply some patches.
      Do I really have to install these?
  <dd> The solution answer again lies with the way
      <code>dyn.load()</code> is called. Make certain that
       the <code>Java.so</code> shared library is loaded
      with the argument <code>local=FALSE</code>.


  <dt>
  <li> When I try to do anything that involves the
       class <code>RForeignReference</code>, Java
       complains about not being able to load a library named
       <code>Java.so</code> and prints a huge call-stack trace.
  <dd>
       The problem is due to one of two things.
       Perhaps you have not set your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
       variable correctly.<br>
       More likely however is that when you installed the package,
       you did not give the R INSTALL command the -c (or --clean)
       argument. This is necessary as it tidies the installation up
       after everything is compiled and made available to R.
       This creates a symbolic link in the
         <code>Java/libs</code> directory that connects Java.so expected by R
       to <code>libJava.so</code> expected by  the Java virtual
      machine.
       In other words, this issues the command
      <pre>
ln -s Java.so libJava.so      
      </pre>
      in the <code>Java/libs</code> directory.
      A script - <code>cleanup</code> -
      will do this for you. It is located in the
      <code>Java/scripts</code> directory where the library was installed.

<h2><a name="Performance">Performance</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Why is the first call to <code>.Java()</code> or
      <code>.JavaConstructor</code> so slow? 
  <dd> Because, the default setup for the Omegahat interpreter
      allows the user to specify partially qualified class names.
      To do this, the Omegahat interpreter must read every
      element in the classpath and construct a list of all the classes
      in all the sub-directories of those elements.
      This takes time!
      <p>
      This lengthy class list construction can be reduced (or
      eliminated).
       Firstly, use  fully-qualified  class names.
      This makes the code more readable, but it is tedious.
<br>
      An alternative is to tell Omegahat which classpath elements
      for which it should construct the class lists.
      This list is specified via the JVM property
      <code>OmegahatClassLists</code>
<pre>
 javaConfig(OmegahatClassLists="./myclasses:/home/me/Java/classes.jar")
</pre>
      See <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/Howto/omegahat.html">The
      Omegahat Howto</a>.
      
</dl>

<h2><a name="Methods">Method Identification</a></h2>
<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> <font class="question">Why do I get anonymous references that
      have class MethodAlias?</font>
  <dd> This means that the <code>.Java</code> call couldn't resolve a
      real Java method, but got one that had the same name and number
      of arguments. One of the most common causes for this in R
      is when one specifies an integer constant (e.g. 0) but it is
      passed to Java as a double/numeric. For example
<pre>
 v <- .JavaConstructor("util.Vector", 3)
</pre>
      The three here is actually of more numeric.
<p>
     
      This behaviour is part of R and S3
      and unfortunately we are stuck with it. (A lot of the R code
      (especially Fortran associated) breaks if this is changed. It
      does not happen in S4.)
